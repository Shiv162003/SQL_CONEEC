# IMDb Data Analysis Project

Welcome to our IMDb Data Analysis project repository! This project aims to showcase our skills in data analysis using IMDb movie data. We have utilized SQL for data manipulation and Python for connecting to the database, performing analysis, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have analyzed IMDb movie data to derive various insights about actors, directors, and movies. By leveraging SQL queries and Python scripts, we have conducted different statistical analyses to uncover patterns, trends, and interesting facts within the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project comprises IMDb movie data, including information about movies, actors, directors, genres, ratings, and more. We have designed an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram to visualize the structure of our database.

## Analysis Tasks

Our analysis includes but is not limited to the following tasks:

- **Top Actors and Directors**: Identifying the most prolific actors and directors based on the number of movies they have participated in.
- **Genre Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of movie genres and determining the most popular genres over time.
- **Rating Trends**: Investigating the trends in movie ratings over the years and identifying any patterns.
- **Collaborations**: Exploring the collaborations between actors and directors to understand which pairs have worked together frequently.
- **Box Office Performance**: Analyzing the box office performance of movies and identifying factors contributing to their success or failure.

## Repository Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains the IMDb dataset in SQL format.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes Python scripts for connecting to the database, executing SQL queries, performing analysis, and generating visualizations.
- **`results/`**: Stores the results of our analysis, including plots, charts, and summary reports.

## Getting Started

To replicate our analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up a local database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
3. Import the IMDb dataset into your database.
4. Configure the database connection parameters in the Python scripts.
5. Run the Python scripts in the `scripts/` directory to execute SQL queries and perform analysis.
6. Explore the results in the `results/` directory and draw your own conclusions.
